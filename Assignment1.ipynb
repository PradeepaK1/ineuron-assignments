    "Ans: \n",
    "There are many data types in python like string (str), integer (int), list, dictionary (dict), tuple, set among those these three, I am going to explain\n",
    "\n",
    "list - enclosed with square brackets [], is similar to array data structure of various other programming languages except to the fact that it can contain multiple data types in it\n",
    "A list can have int, str also another list itself as an element, the indexing of list starts from 0,1,2 where 0 is the index given to first element\n",
    "List is a mutable data type to which deletion, appending can all be made and one can iterate over the list through loops\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple - enclosed with curve brackets (), is similar to list data type with one modification that tuples are immutable which prevents append function to a tuple\n",
    "A tuple also can have multiple data typed elements also duplicates of those, it is ordered and hence here also indexing starts from 0,1,2.. it can also be iterated through loops\n",
    "\n",
    "dict - enclosed with {} a dictionary has key value pair of combination {Key:Value} {'name' :'Pradeepa'}, {a: 10}\n",
    "A dictionary can have duplicate value but unique keys, and can be accessed with the help of key and value for operations in the program\n"
