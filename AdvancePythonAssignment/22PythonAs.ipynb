    "    Memory allocation is in contiguous memory locations so, no chance of extra memory being allocated\n",

    "    They are much more fast and efficient\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can use many built-in methods on array like len(), append(), extend() which will make our work easier\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Type conversion is easier from array to list etc\n",
    "    \n",
